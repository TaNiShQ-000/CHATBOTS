# POWER_CONSUMPTION analysis
**data science project that analyse the dataset for patterns and predict future values**

ABOUT THE DATASET- "usage" dataset contains record of consumption of power in KWH and date-time stamp "weather" dataset contains detils about the weather on that specific datetime such -> temprature, due , wind speed, humidity (min/max/avg)

LIBRARIES USED-> numpy, pandas ,seaborn ,matplotlib , sklearn

a combined data was used so as to extract all corelation between atmosphere and power condition as welll as the dependence on time feature like the -what time of day it is -day of the week -week of the year -month of the year

the model was trained using the random forest regressor and then a neural network so as to find out which type suits the data best a neural network of (20810) with batch normalisation and dropout layers were also used in the network
